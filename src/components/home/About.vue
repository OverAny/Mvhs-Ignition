Based in Mountain View High School, the IoT Club (later known as the Ignition Club) was founded by two friends in the freshman year. Inspired by emerging technologies all over the Silicon Valley, the founders were amazed at the positive impacts IoT technologies could have.

Drawn together by this common passion, they formed the IoT Club, which quickly attracted students from all over the school. It similarly achieved success rapidly, claiming second prize at one of the biggest professional hackathons in just three months.

The high school club continues to compete and win prizes, while teaching its newest members. The club attracts mentors from various leading companies in the IoT field, including IBM, Amazon, Intel, and PubNub.
