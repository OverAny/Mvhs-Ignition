First, starting at 6am every day, the Raspberry Pi starts receiving signals from the motion sensor. When motion is detected, the Pi connects to the user’s Google Calendar and extrapolates the data for the first event of the day. It then takes the location of this event, plugs it into the Weather API, and receives the weather at that location.
