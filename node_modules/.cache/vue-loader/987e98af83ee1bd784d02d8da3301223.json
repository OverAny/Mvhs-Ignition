Deciding that we had little to no chance of winning anything, our team decided to take their time and eat a proper lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. As we sat down, one of our members received a phone call, informing us that we had made the top 5 projects and had 10 minutes to set up for our presentation. Having received many spam calls before, coupled with the audio being drowned out by the noise of the restaurant, he simply replied “sorry, you have the wrong number” and hung up. A minute later, the same member read his e-mails, one of them repeating the same message, and told the team. We pitched on stage for the judges, as well as the other hackers.
